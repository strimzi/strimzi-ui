Feature: core module

    Behaviours and capabilities provided by the core module

    Scenario: When making a call with no strimzi-ui header, one is added for later requests
        Given a server with a 'mockapi' configuration
        And I run an instance of the Strimzi-UI server
        When I make a request with no unique request header
        Then a unique request header is returned in the response

    Scenario: When making a call with a strimzi-ui header, that header is used in the request
        Given a server with a 'mockapi' configuration
        And I run an instance of the Strimzi-UI server
        When I make a request with a unique request header
        Then the unique request header sent is returned in the response

    Scenario: When making a call to the strimzi-ui server, the expected secuirty headers are present
        Given a server with a 'mockapi' configuration
        And I run an instance of the Strimzi-UI server
        When I make a 'get' request to '/api/test'
        Then all expected security headers are present

    Scenario: If two modules mount routes on the same mounting point, and one is disabled, the enabled module is invoked
        Given a server with a 'mockapi' configuration
        And I run an instance of the Strimzi-UI server
        When I make a 'get' request to '/api/test'
        Then the mockapi handler is called

    Scenario: When making a call to the strimzi-ui server, the expected session cookie is present
        Given a server with a 'mockapi' configuration
        And a session identifier of 'server-name'
        And I run an instance of the Strimzi-UI server
        When I make a 'get' request to '/'
        Then the response sets a cookie named 'server-name'
