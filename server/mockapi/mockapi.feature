    Scenario: Returns with the expected response for a mocked api call
        Given a server with a 'mockapi' configuration
        And I run an instance of the Strimzi-UI server
        When I make a 'mockTopicsQuery' gql request to '/api'
        Then I get the expected mockapi response

    Scenario: Returns with the expected response for a call to the test endpoint
        Given a server with a 'mockapi' configuration
        And I run an instance of the Strimzi-UI server
        When I make a 'get' request to '/api/test'
        Then I get the expected mockapi test endpoint response
